## How I built this

1. [Followed this guide + repo](https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/add-svelte-to-aspnet-core-projects)
2. Got a basic build going with a `Counter.svelte`
3. Next is Tailwind: [Tailwind+Svelte](https://medium.com/@mdwikycahyo/how-to-set-up-svelte-using-vite-and-tailwind-css-617040ebccec)
4. Used this [fix](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/4446) to get rollup and yarn to cooperate.
5. Finally, trying to deploy to Railway.app.
